# Amazon-Web-Scraper

I developed an Amazon web scraper using Python to extract data on the prices and availability of various products. I utilized Beautiful Soup and Scrapy to crawl Amazon's website and pull data on prices, ratings, and product features.

In addition to developing the web scraper using Python and industry-standard libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, I utilized machine learning techniques to predict the best time to purchase a product based on historical pricing data.

To gather this historical data, I implemented data scraping methods to collect pricing information over time for various products on Amazon. This data was then cleaned and transformed using Pandas and Numpy and fed into a machine-learning algorithm to create a predictive model.

The machine learning model used various features such as product category, seller reputation, and historical pricing data to predict the optimal purchase time. I built a predictive model using regression algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict the best time to buy a product and obtain the lowest price. By continuously updating this model with new data, the system was able to adapt to changes in pricing patterns and provide highly accurate predictions.

I also implemented a user-friendly web interface using Flask, which allowed users to search for a particular product and receive a recommendation on the best time to purchase it. The interface also displayed historical pricing trends and other relevant information to assist users in making informed purchasing decisions.

I utilized cloud computing services such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform to deploy the system to ensure scalability and reliability. Additionally, I incorporated various data visualization techniques using tools like Matplotlib and Tableau to create interactive dashboards that allow users to visualize the pricing trends of products over time.

Overall, this project allowed me to leverage my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
